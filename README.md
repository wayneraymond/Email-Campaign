<h1>Basic HTML Email Campaign Template</h1>

This is a basic HTML template for Email Campaigns, including resets for some of the email clients (which suck and have done since forever because nobody can be bothered updating them and making them complient with W3C standards -- phew! glad I got that off my chest.).

<hr/>

<h2>Notes</h2>
The style is placed within the body tags because some email clients strip them out of the head tags. Rock and roll.
